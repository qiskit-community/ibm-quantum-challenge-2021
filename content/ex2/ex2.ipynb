    "# Exercise 2 - Shor's algorithm\n",
    "## Historical background\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, we often measure the performance of an algorithm by how it grows with the size of the input problem. For example, addition has an algorithm that grows linearly with the size of the numbers we're adding. There are some computing problems for which the best algorithms we have grow _exponentially_ with the size of the input, and this means inputs with a relatively modest size are too big to solve using any computer on earth. We're so sure of this, much of the internet's security depends on certain problems being unsolvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1994, Peter Shor showed that it’s possible to factor a number into its primes efficiently on a quantum computer.[1] This is big news, as the best classical algorithm we know of is one of these algorithms that grows exponentially. And in fact, [RSA encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) relies on factoring large enough numbers being infeasible. To factor integers that are too big for our current classical computers will require millions of qubits and gates, and these circuits are far too big to run on today’s quantum computers successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how did Lieven M.K. Vandersypen, Matthias Steffen, Gregory Breyta, Costantino S. Yannoni, Mark H. Sherwood and Isaac L. Chuang manage to factor 15 on a quantum computer, all the way back in 2001?![2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty in creating circuits for Shor’s algorithm is creating the circuit that computes a controlled $ay \\bmod N$. While we know how to create these circuits using a polynomial number of gates, these are still too large for today’s computers. Fortunately, if we know some information about the problem a priori, then we can sometimes ‘cheat’ and create more efficient circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this circuit on the hardware available to them, the authors of the above paper found a very simple circuit that performed $7y \\bmod 15$. This made the circuit small enough to run on their hardware. By the end of this exercise, you will have created a circuit for $35y \\bmod N$ that can be used in Shor’s algorithm and can run on `ibmq_santiago`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to understand what's going on in this exercise, you should check out the [Qiskit Textbook page on Shor's algorithm](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/shor.html), but if this is too involved for you, you can complete the exercise without this.\n",

    "## tl;dr: Shor’s algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an algorithm called [_quantum phase estimation_](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-phase-estimation.html) that tells us the phase a gate introduces to a certain type of state. For example, inputs to phase estimation algorithm could be the state $|1\\rangle$ and the gate $Z$. If the $Z$-gate acts on the state $|1\\rangle$, we get back the same state with an added global phase of $\\pi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z|1\\rangle = -|1\\rangle = e^{i\\pi} |1\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the quantum phase estimation algorithm could work this out for us. You can see another example [here](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-phase-estimation.html#2.-Example:-T-gate-).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor showed that if we do phase estimation on a gate, $U$, that has the behavior $U|y\\rangle = |a y\\bmod N\\rangle$, we can quickly get some information about $N$’s factors."

    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will factor 35 by doing phase estimation on a circuit that implements $13y \\bmod 35$. The exercise is to create a circuit that does this, and is also small enough to run on `ibmq_santiago`! This is not an easy task, so the first thing we’re going to do is cheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detail of Shor’s algorithm is that our circuit only needs to work on states we can reach through applying $U$ to the starting state $|1\\rangle$. I.e. we can use _any_ circuit that has the behavior: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "U|1\\rangle &= |13\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "UU|1\\rangle &= |29\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "UUU|1\\rangle &= |27\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "UUUU|1\\rangle &= |1\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we make this easier for us? Since we only need to correctly transform 4 different states, we can encode these onto two qubits. For this exercise, we will choose to map the 2-qubit computational basis states to the numbers like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "|1\\rangle &\\rightarrow |00\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "|13\\rangle &\\rightarrow |01\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "|29\\rangle &\\rightarrow |10\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "|27\\rangle &\\rightarrow |11\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this “cheating”? Well, to take advantage of this optimization, we need to know all the states $U$ is going to affect, which means we have to compute $ay \\bmod N$ until we get back to 1 again, and that means we know the period of $a^x \\bmod N$ and can therefore get the factors of $N$. Any optimization like this, in which we use information that would tell us the value $r$, is obviously not going to scale to problems that classical computers can’t solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the purpose of this exercise is just to verify that Shor’s algorithm does in fact work as intended, and we’re not going to worry about the fact that we cheated to get a circuit for $U$.\n",

    "If your score was low enough, you should see we have a high probability of measuring $0$, $2$, $4$ or $8$ as we saw with the perfect simulation. You will see some extra results due to inaccuracies in the processor and unwanted things interacting with our qubits. This 'noise' gets worse the longer our circuit is, as longer computation time means more time for unwanted interactions, and more gates means more potential errors. This is why we needed to cheat to create the smallest circuit possible.\n",
