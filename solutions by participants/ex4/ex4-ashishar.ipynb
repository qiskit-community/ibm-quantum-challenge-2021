    "# Exercise 4 - Transmon qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical background\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, a qubit is the basic unit of quantum information. It is essentially a two-level quantum mechanical system, can be implemented in many physical systems, including natural systems such as electron spins (spin qubit), atomic levels in ions (trapped ion qubits) or artificial systems such as states in a superconducting circuit (superconducting qubit).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original superconducting qubit was the Cooper Pair Box debuted in 1999[1], in which a well-defined number of Cooper pairs (bound electrons in a superconductor) occupy an island of superconductor weakly coupled to a lead by a Josephson junction. In Cooper pair box qubit, the energy difference between the $|0\\rangle$ state (no Cooper Pairs) and $|1\\rangle$ state (a single Cooper Pair)is strongly dependent on any stray or applied electrostatic charges in or around the system. This sensitivity to charge noise leads to qubit dephasing. The qubit dephasing time ($T_2$) for Cooper pair box qubit is typically limited to ~ 1$\\mu s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key discovery behind the transmon qubit, first proposed in 2007[2], is that this energy dependence on voltage (known as dispersion) is periodic. By introducing a shunting capacitor, the ratio between the Josephson energy and charging energy $E_J/E_c$ become very large ~ 50, leading to a flat charge dispersion. While Cooper pair box is very sensitive to the charge noise (i.e. uncertainty in x axis position in Fig. 1a), it is largely suppressed in transmon qubit (Fig. 1d). The qubit dephasing time ($T_2$) for transmon qubit is improved significantly. In IBM Quantum systems, $T_2$ is typically ~ 100 $\\mu s$. See [`ibmq_santiago`](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services?skip=0&systems=all&system=ibmq_santiago) for example.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will investigate the characteristic energies of the transmon qubit by performing spectroscopy with a real IBM Quantum system. the ratio between the Josephson energy and charging energy $E_J/E_c$ is the key to solving the charge noise problem of its predecessor, the Cooper Pair Box qubit.\n",

    "## Energy levels and characteristic energies of the transmon qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian of quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) can be obtained by quantizing the Hamiltonian of a linear LC circuit. Its energy levels are equally spaced (Fig. 2c). By introducing a non-linear circuit element, the Josephson junction, the energy levels of the transmon qubit is modified (Fig. 2d). The energy levels are no longer equally spaced. Higher energy level spacing is smaller than those of lower energies. The anharmonicity $\\delta$ is defined as the energy difference between $|1\\rangle \\rightarrow |2\\rangle$ and $|0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1\\rangle$ transition: $\\delta = \\hbar \\omega_{12} - \\hbar \\omega_{01}$ or simply $\\omega_{12} - \\omega_{01}$ (we'll set $\\hbar \\equiv 1$ for the remainder of this discussion). By tuning the microwave frequency to $\\omega_{01}$, we can effectively address the multi-level transmon as a two-level system, i.e. a qubit.\n",

    "In superconductors, electrons form Cooper pairs with the effective charge of $2e$, where $e$ is the charge of a single electron. The charging energy $E_c$ is the energy cost of adding a single Cooper pair to the qubit and is related to the capacitance of the superconducting circuit. The Josephson energy $E_J$ is the energy of the Cooper pairs tunneling through the Josephson junction. In transmon qubits, the inductive energy is wholly provided by the Josephson junction, but this is not true of other styles of superconducting qubit (for information on the design and analysis of superconducting qubits, [Qiskit Metal](https://qiskit.org/metal/) has recently been released!).\n",

    "We will use $f$ to replace $\\omega$ as the symbol for frequency for the rest of the notebook, because it is more commonly used for microwave. The anharmonicity $\\delta$ is wholly provided by the charging energy $E_c$. Physically, this is incorporated as a large *shunting* (parallel) capacitor to the junction. This addition allows well-separated transmon levels while suppressing susceptibility to the charge noise. "
